# Basic Image Editor

First exercise with openCV to learn use files and draw on them. 


## Exercise Description

Build an OpenCV application with Python which opens an image from a file and shows it on the screen (the path to the image can be hard coded). Implement some simple drawing functionality providing a user the possibility to draw lines and frames (unfilled rectangles) with the mouse on the loaded image.

More specifically, this is how the application should work from the user's point of view. To draw a:

* *line*, first press 'l' on the keyboard and then hold down the left mouse button and drag. The line will be drawn from the point where you pressed the left mouse button to the point where you released the left mouse button

* *rectangle*, first press 'r' on the keyboard and then hold down the left mouse button and drag. The rectangle will be drawn in such a way that the upper left corner of the rectangle will be placed where you pressed down the left mouse button and the bottom right corner will be placed where you released the left mouse button.
 
The user shall be able to save the edited image by pressing 's' (the name of this saved file can be hard coded).


At the end, the user shall be able to close the application by pressing 'q'
