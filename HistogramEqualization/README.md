# Histogram Equalization

## 1. Plot the histogram of 3 different images

Write a short report, with the plotted histograms and images before and after HE, as well as your comments.

## 2. Try to improve the contrast of each image by applying histogram equalization

Plot the histograms of all images after HE and comment on whether HE has worked.

## 3. Search the Internet for an appropriate JPG image on which HE does not appear to have any perceptual effect? 

Explain why, this may be so?
