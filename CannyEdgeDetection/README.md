# Canny Edge Detection

##  1. Download two different images and try to create edge maps from both images using Canny 

Download at least two different images (one with clear and another one with "not so clear" edges) from the Internet and try to create edge maps from both images using Canny edge detection. Add screenshots from the original images as well as the  edge map images. Comment on your findings. 

##  2. Now try to create an edge map from the image "face.jpg" that we used in in Assignment 4

Now try to create an edge map from the image "face.jpg" that we used in in Assignment 4. Again you need to apply some preprocessing of the image before applying Canny edge detection. Compare the results with the Sobel edge detector. Provide some suitable critical comments on how you obtained your final image (edge map).
